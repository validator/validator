Fix John Cowan's bug.

Preserve directory structure on output.

Command line option to disable use of substitution groups in XSD output.

Going from DTDs to XSD, automatically set inlineAttlistDecls.

Expose inlineAttlistDecls option in Driver.

With DTD output, deal with characters outside repertoire of character
encoding.

Detect unencodable characters in comments in XmlWriter.  Also in
attribute names (from namespace prefixes).

When inlining attlist decls in DTD input, comments should be inlined
also.  Maybe inlining attlist decls should be separate later
transformation.  Also need to fix XSD output to deal with such
comments.

In trang documentation, move some information about DTD conversion
into general section.

Should output a:documentation as comments in the DTD.
