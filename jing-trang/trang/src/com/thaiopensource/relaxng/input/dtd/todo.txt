Option to control definition of any (anything at all, not allowed,
choice of all defined elements, choice of all namespaces with defined
elements).

Option to map comments into annotations (or maybe should be separate program).

Generate definition for any in one place.

Output overridden definitions.

Try to preserve marked sections.

Annotation for included sections (d:condition="flagName")

When inlining attlist decls, comments should be inlined also.  Maybe
inlining attlist decls should be separate later transformation.  Also
need to fix XSD output to deal with such comments.
