<h2>Translator for RELAX NG Schemas</h2>

<h3>Version @VERSION@</h3>

<p>Trang translates schemas written in RELAX NG into different
formats. In particular, it can</p>

<ul>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in the compact syntax into the XML syntax</li>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in either the XML or compact syntax
into a DTD</li>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in either the XML or compact syntax
into a W3C XML Schema</li>

</ul>

<p>Trang aims to produce human-understandable schemas; it tries for a
translation that preserves all aspects of the input schema that may be
significant to a human reader, including the definitions, the way the
schema is divided into files, annotations and comments.</p>

<p>The implementation is available for download as</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="trang-bin.zip">JAR</a> file</li>

<li><a href="trang-src.zip">source code</a> (this uses the
<a href="jing-src.zip">Jing source code</a>)</li>

</ul>

<p>The main class is
<code>com.thaiopensource.relaxng.output.Driver</code>.</p>

<p>Trang requires at least two command-line arguments: the first is
the URI or filename of the schema to be translated; the second is the
output filename.</p>

<p>Trang infers the input and output format from the extension of
input and output filenames as follows:</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>.rng</code></dt>
<dd>RELAX NG (XML syntax)</dd>

<dt><code>.rnc</code></dt>

<dd>RELAX NG compact syntax</dd>

<dt><code>.dtd</code></dt>

<dd>XML 1.0 DTD</dd>

<dt><code>.xsd</code></dt>

<dd>W3C XML Schema</dd>

</dl>

<p>This inference can be overridden using the <code>-i</code> and
<code>-o</code> options.</p>

<p>Trang accepts the following command-line options:</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>-i <var>format</var></code></dt>

<dd><code><var>format</var></code> specifies the input format as follows:

<dl>

<dt><code>rng</code></dt>
<dd>RELAX NG (XML syntax)</dd>

<dt><code>rnc</code></dt>

<dd>RELAX NG compact syntax</dd>

</dl>
</dd>

<dt><code>-o <var>format</var></code></dt>

<dd><code><var>format</var></code> specifies the output format
as follows:

<dl>

<dt><code>rng</code></dt>
<dd>RELAX NG (XML syntax)</dd>

<dt><code>dtd</code></dt>

<dd>XML 1.0 DTD</dd>

<dt><code>.xsd</code></dt>

<dd>W3C XML Schema</dd>

</dl>
</dd>


<dt><code>-e <var>enc</var></code></dt>

<dd>Use the encoding <code><var>enc</var></code> for schema input and
output.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>DTD output</h2>

<p>The DTD output module of Trang has many limitations. There are many
RELAX NG features that it cannot handle, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>Wildcards</li>

<li>Multiple <code>element</code> patterns with the same name</li>

<li><code>externalRef</code></li>

<li>overriding definitions (in an <code>include</code>)</li>

<li>combining definitions with <code>combine="choice"</code></li>

</ul>

<p>However, Trang can handle many RELAX NG features, including some
that go beyond the capabilities of DTDs.  When some part of a RELAX NG
schema cannot be represented exactly in DTD, Trang will try to
<i>approximate</i> it. The approximation will always be more general,
that is, the DTD will allow everything that is allowed by the RELAX NG
schema, but there may be some things that are allowed by the DTD that
are not allowed by the RELAX NG schema.  For example, if the RELAX NG
schema specifies that the content of an element is a string conforming
to some datatype, then Trang will make the content of the element be
<code>(#PCDATA)</code>; or if the RELAX NG schema specifies a choice
between two attributes <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, then the DTD
will allow both <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> optionally. Whenever
Trang approximates, it will give a warning message.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to generate a DTD but need to use some
feature of RELAX NG that Trang is unable to convert into a DTD, then
you might try one of the following approaches:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create a RELAX NG schema including the features you need, and then
use XSLT (or some other XML transformation language) to transform the
schema into something that Trang can handle, perhaps making use of
annotations in the schema to guide the transformation.</li>

<li>Create a RELAX NG schema <var>S</var><sub>1</sub> which uses only
features that Trang can handle but which, consequently, does not
capture all the desired constraints; then create a second RELAX NG
schema <var>S</var><sub>2</sub> that <code>include</code>s
<var>S</var><sub>1</sub>, and overrides definitions in
<var>S</var><sub>1</sub> replacing them with definitions that make
unrestricted use of the features of RELAX NG.</li>

</ul>

<h2>W3C XML Schema</h2>

<p>This is still under active development. It currently has several
limitations including:</p>

<ul>

<li>it may generate schemas that violate W3C XML Schema's restrictions
on ambiguous content models;</li>

<li>it may generate schemas that violate W3C XML Schema's restrictions
on consistent element types;</li>

<li>when the RELAX NG schema cannot be represented by W3C XML Schema,
a generalization is generated; it should give a warning in this case,
but does not always do so.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Future plans</h2>

<p>Trang is constructed around a RELAX NG object model designed to
support schema conversion.  Trang can support additional input and
output formats simply by adding modules that convert these formats
from and to this object model.</p>

<p>Features planned for future releases include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Provide an output module for the RELAX NG compact syntax</li>

<li>Enhance the DTD output module to support more features of RELAX
NG</li>

<li>Adapt <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/dtdinst/">DTDinst</a> for use
as a DTD input module</li>

</ul>

<h2>Related software</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/dtdinst/">DTDinst</a>
translates from DTDs into RELAX NG; like Trang, it tries for a
translation that preserves definitions and file structure.  Trang can
handle all the features in RELAX NG schemas generated by DTDinst.</p>

<p>The <a
href="http://www.sun.com/software/xml/developers/relaxngconverter/">Sun
RELAX NG Converter</a> converts from a variety of different schema
languages into RELAX NG.  However, it is based on an object model
which is designed to support validation, and so does not preserve
aspects of the input schemas that are irrelevant for validation (such
as the definitional structure).</p>
