<h3>Version @VERSION@</h3>

<p>Trang is constructed around a RELAX NG object model designed to
support schema conversion.  Trang can support additional input and
output formats simply by adding modules that convert these formats
from and to this object model.</p>

<p>Trang translates schemas written in <a
href="http://relaxng.org">RELAX NG</a> into different formats. In
particular, it can</p>

<ul>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in the compact syntax into the XML syntax</li>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in the XML syntax into the compact syntax</li>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in either the XML or compact syntax
into a DTD</li>

<li>translate a RELAX NG schema in either the XML or compact syntax
into a W3C XML Schema</li>

</ul>

<p>Trang aims to produce human-understandable schemas; it tries for a
translation that preserves all aspects of the input schema that may be
significant to a human reader, including the definitions, the way the
schema is divided into files, annotations and comments.</p>

<h2>Getting Trang</h2>

<p>The implementation is available for download as</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href="trang-bin.zip">JAR</a> file</li>

<li><a href="trang-src.zip">source code</a> (this uses the
<a href="jing-src.zip">Jing source code</a>)</li>

</ul>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Detailed information about using Trang is in the <a
href="trang-manual.html">manual</a>.</p>

<p>Some background information on the conversion to W3C XML Schema is
available in the <a href="convert-to-xsd-talk.html">slides</a> for a
talk given a XML 2002.</p>

<h2>Related software</h2>

<p>The <a
href="http://www.sun.com/software/xml/developers/relaxngconverter/">Sun
RELAX NG Converter</a> converts from a variety of different schema
languages into RELAX NG.  However, it is based on an object model
which is designed to support validation, and so does not preserve
aspects of the input schemas that are irrelevant for validation (such
as the definitional structure).</p>
