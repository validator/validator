<h3>Version @VERSION@</h3>

<p>Trang converts between different schema languages for XML. It
supports the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>RELAX NG (XML syntax)</li>
<li>RELAX NG compact syntax</li>
<li>XML 1.0 DTDs</li>
<li>W3C XML Schema</li>
</ul>

<p>A schema written in any of the supported schema languages can be
converted into any of the other supported schema languages, except
that W3C XML Schema is supported for output only, not for input.</p>

<p>Trang can also infer a schema from one or more example XML
documents.</p>

<p>Trang is constructed around an RELAX NG object model designed to
support schema conversion.  For each schema language supported for
input, there is an input module that can convert from the schema
language into this internal object model.  Similarly, for each schema
language supported for output, there is an output module that can
convert from the internal object model in the schema language.</p>

<p>Trang aims to produce human-understandable schemas; it tries for a
translation that preserves all aspects of the input schema that may be
significant to a human reader, including the definitions, the way the
schema is divided into files, annotations and comments.</p>

<p>Trang has a command-line user interface.  It has no graphical user
interface.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>

<p>The
file <a href="http://jing-trang.googlecode.com/files/trang-@VERSION@.zip"
>trang-@VERSION@.zip</a> contains Trang version @VERSION@ including
binaries, source code and documentation.  It requires a Java runtime
compatible with the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) version 5
(or any later version), such as the Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
which can be
downloaded <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>The latest version of Trang will aalways be available in
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/downloads/list">Downloads</a>
section of the <a href="http://jing-trang.googlecode.com">project
site</a>.</p>

<h2>Further information</h2>

<p>Detailed information about using Trang is in the <a
href="trang-manual.html">manual</a>.</p>

<p>Some background information on the conversion to W3C XML Schema is
available in the <a href="convert-to-xsd-talk.html">slides</a> for a
talk given a XML 2002.</p>

<h2>Participate</h2>

<p>Development of Trang, together
with <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/jing.html">Jing</a>,
takes place in
the <a href="http://jing-trang.googlecode.com">jing-trang project</a>,
which is hosted on Google Code.</p>

<p>If you find a bug or would like to request an enhancement, please
create a new issue in
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/issues/list">Issues</a>
section of the project site. You can talk with other users of Trang on
the <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rng-users/">rng-users</a>
mailing list.</p>

<p>If you want to make changes to Trang, you
should <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jing-trang/source/checkout">check
out</a> the source code from the project's Subversion repository. (The
source code included in the Trang download is for reference purposes,
and doesn't contain the supporting files, such as build scripts and
test cases, that are needed for working conveniently with the source
code.)</p>


<h2>Related software</h2>

<p>Trang's DTD input module uses <a
href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/dtdinst/">DTDinst</a>.
The Trang distribution already includes the necessary parts of
DTDinst, so there is no need to download DTDinst just in order to use
Trang.  DTDinst is also available as an independent program that
outputs an XML representation of an XML DTD.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://msv.dev.java.net/">Sun Multi-Schema
Validator</a> includes the rngconv tool, which converts from a variety
of different schema languages into RELAX NG.  However, it is based on
an object model which is designed to support validation, and so does
not preserve aspects of the input schemas that are irrelevant for
validation (such as the definitional structure).</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.brics.dk/schematools/">schematools</a>
package does schema conversion based around a restricted subset of
RELAX NG. It supports conversion from W3C XML Schema to RELAX NG.</p>
