Switch to current, open-source version of JavaCC.

Add DTD validator

Add build.xml for jing.

Provide a validate method on Validator so that we can avoid messing
with threads in some cases.

Add doc with hints about how to run jars.

Set Xerces properties to read DTDs but not validate

Option to control DTD parsing

Driver should check for options inappropriate for schema language

Insist that the property
map passed to schema.createValidator contains an error handler or
maybe use DraconianErrorHandler by default.

Maybe rename Validator to ValidationHandlers.

The SAX RELAX NG parser should use any EntityResolver supplied in the
PropertyMap by wrapping a class round the XMLReaderCreator which sets
the specified EntityResolver before returning it.

The SAX Compact syntax parser should be able to use an entity resolver.

Allow PropertyIds to be used to represent SAX properties/features.
Make use of them in the various SchemaReader implementations.

Move com.thaiopensource.relaxng.util to
com.thaiopensource.validate.driver?

Should have option for specifying non-XML language in a general way.

Auto-detect compact/XML syntax.

Compact syntax parser should provide encoding information.

Give a warning for a list containing a single token.

Give a more helpful message for sequence of strings
outside a list.

Handle comments embedded within strings better.

Put location information in error messages into a standard format
understandable by Emacs.

More helpful syntax error messages with compact syntax parser.

Support for IDREF checking via JARV.

In a big choice or interleave or attribute group, memoization for each
binary pattern is inefficient.

Option to recover from unknown datatype libraries.

More helpful error message for duplicate attributes.

Implement ValidationContext.getBaseUri in the instance.

Support infoset modification for ID/IDREF/IDREFS.

Support DTD compatibility use of default values.

Option to do XInclude before validation.

Maybe introduce a variant of the element pattern that has a mapping
from names to content models.

Better error message for wrong namespace URI.

Option to be verbose.

Streaming validation of data.
