.TH jing 1 @VERSION@
.SH NAME
jing \- validate an XML document using a RELAX NG schema
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B jing
.RB [ \-cfit ]
.RB [ \-e
.IR encoding ]
.I rng-file
.RI [ xml-file ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If
.I rng-file
is a correct RELAX NG schema and each
.I xml-file
is a well-formed XML document that is valid with respect to
.IR rng-file ,
then
.B jing
will be silent and terminate with a status of 0.
Otherwise,
.B jing
will report one or more errors to the standard
output and will terminate with a status of 1.
Both
.I rng-file
and
.I xml-file
can be filenames or URIs.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-c
Uses the compact syntax for the schema.
.TP
.BI \-e " enc"
Uses the encoding
.I enc
to read the schema.
.TP
.BI \-f
Checks that the document is feasibly valid. A document is feasibly
valid if it could be transformed into a valid document by inserting
any number of attributes and child elements anywhere in the tree.
This is equivalent to transforming the schema by wrapping every
.BR data ,
.BR list ,
.B element
and
.B attribute
element in an
.B optional
element and then validating against the transformed schema. This
option may be useful while a document is still under construction.
This option also disables checking that for every IDREF there is a
corresponding ID.
.TP
.B \-i
Disables checking of ID/IDREF/IDREFS. By default,
Jing enforces the constraints imposed by RELAX NG DTD Compatibility
with respect to ID/IDREF/IDREFS.
.TP
.B \-t
Prints the time used by Jing for loading the schema and
for validation.
