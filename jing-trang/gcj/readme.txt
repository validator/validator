The RPMs require libgcj-3.2. This is included with RedHat 8.0. You can
download the libgcj-3.2 RPM from:

http://rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/redhat/8.0/i386/libgcj-3.2-7.i386.html

However, the libgcj RPM depends on particular versions of libgcc and
glibc.  So, if you are not running RedHat 8, you might find it easier
to rebuild the RPMs from source.  You would need gcc-3.2 or later
installed with Java enabled.  Then you can rebuild the RPMs using:

rpmbuild -ta jing-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
rpmbuild -ta trang-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz
