<h1>Modular Namespaces (MNS)</h1>

<p>In its simplest form, a Modular Namespaces (MNS) schema consists of a
mapping from namespace URIs to schema URIs.  An MNS schema is written
in XML.  Here is a RELAX NG compact syntax schema for this simplest
form of MNS schema:</p>

<pre>
default namespace = "http://www.thaiopensource.com/ns/mns"

element rules {
  element validateElement {
    attribute ns { xsd:anyURI },
    attribute schema { xsd:anyURI }
  }*
}
</pre>

<p>Validity of an instance with respect to a MNS schema is determined
as follows.  First, a set of <em>validation subjects</em> is
identified.  Each validation subject is an element in the instance.
Associated with each validation subject is a schema.  If all the
validation subjects are valid with respect to their associated
schemas, then the instance is considered valid with respect to the MNS
schema.</p>

<p>It is important to understand that when a validation subject is
validated with respect to its schema, then it is validated along with
all its descendants and attributes.  One validation subject may have
other validation subjects as ancestors. In this case, a validation
subject will be validated with respect to more than one schema.  Not
only will it be validated with respect to its schema, but it will also
be validated as part of validation of ancestor validation subjects
with respect to their schemas.</p>

<p>By default, an element is a <em>potential validation subject</em>
if has no parent or if its namespace URI is different from that of its
parent. A potential validation subject becomes a validation subject if
there is <code>validateElement</code> rule for its namespace URI.  The
associated schema is specified by the <code>schema</code> attribute of
the <code>validateElement</code> element.  The value of the
<code>ns</code> attribute of the <code>validateElement</code> element
can be the empty string to specify the absent namespace URI.</p>

<p>MNS has additional features that provide further control over the
selection of validation subjects and their associated schemas.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>Attributes can also be validation subjects:</p>

<pre>
default namespace = "http://www.thaiopensource.com/ns/mns"

element rules {
  element validateElement|validateAttributes {
    attribute ns { xsd:anyURI },
    attribute schema { xsd:anyURI }
  }*
}
</pre>

<p>If an element has attributes that are namespace qualified with a
namespace URI other than the namespace URI of the element itself, then
the set of all attributes on that element with that namespace URI is a
potential validation subject.  If there is a
<code>validateAttributes</code> element for that namespace URI, then
it becomes a validation subject.  The associated schema is specified
by the <code>schema</code> attribute of the
<code>validateAttributes</code> element. Unqualified attributes are
never validation subjects.</p>

<p>Note that it is <code>validationAttribute<b>s</b></code>, because
attributes are validated as a set with respect to their schema, but it
is <code>validationElement</code> because an element is individually
validated with respect to its schema.</p>

<p>Normally, schema languages (including RELAX NG) validate an element
rather than a set of attributes.  To work around this, MNS performs
parallel transformations on the set of attributes and on the schema.
The set of attributes is transformed by attaching the attributes to an
element with a particular namespace name and namespace URI. The schema
identified by a <code>validateAttributes</code> element is transformed
to match. In the case of RELAX NG, when a
<code>validateAttributes</code> element specifies a schema of
<code><var>s</var></code>, MNS actually uses a schema of:</p>

<pre>
element <var>e</var> { external "<var>s</var>" }
</pre>

<p>where <code><var>e</var></code> is the name of the element to which
the attributes were attached.</p>

<h2>Strict processing</h2>

<p>The <code>rules</code> element may include an empty
<code>strict</code> element:</p>

<pre>
default namespace = "http://www.thaiopensource.com/ns/mns"

element rules {
   element validateElement|validateAttribute {
    attribute ns { xsd:anyURI },
    attribute schema { xsd:anyURI }
   }*
   &amp; element strict { empty }?
}
</pre>

<p>This makes processing <em>strict</em> instead of <em>lax</em>.
With strict processing, it is an error if there is no applicable
<code>validateElement</code> or <code>validateAttributes</code>
element for a potential validation subject.</p>

<p class="note">Should strictness be specified separately for element
and attribute potential validation subjects?</p>

<h2>Validation subjects with multiple namespaces</h2>

<p>By default, an element is a potential validation subject if its
namespace URI is different from its parent.  This behavior can be
changed by adding one or more <code>cover</code> children to
<code>validateElement</code> elements.</p>

<pre>
default namespace = "http://www.thaiopensource.com/ns/mns"

start =
  element rules {
     validate* &amp; element strict { empty }?
  }

validate =
  element validateElement {
    validateModel,
    element subsume { nsAtt }*
  }
  | element validateAttributes { validateModel }

validateModel = nsAtt, attribute schema { xsd:anyURI }

nsAtt = attribute ns { xsd:anyURI }
</pre>

<p>With the introduction of <code>cover</code> elements, the rule is
that an element is a potential validation subject if it is not
<em>covered</em> by an ancestor validation subject.  Each validation
subject has a set of namespace URIs that it covers.  A validation
subject always covers it own namespace URI.  In addition, it covers
the namespace URIs specified by the <code>cover</code> elements in its
<code>validationElement</code> element.  The set elements covered by a
validation subject is determined from the set of namespace URI that it
covers by the following two rules:</p>

<ul>

<li>a validation subject covers itself;</li>

<li>an element is covered by a validation subject if its parent
element and its namespace URI is covered by that validation
subject.</li>

</ul>

<p>The rule for attributes is very similar. A set of attributes is a
potential validation subject if and only if:</p>

<ul>

<li>the attributes are namespace qualified with a namespace URI
different from the namespace URI of the parent element, and</li>

<li>the attributes are not covered by an ancestor validation
subject.</li>

</ul>

<p>Just as with elements, an attribute is covered by an validation
subject if its parent element and its namespace URI are covered by
that validation subject.</p>

<p>Note that a <code>validationElement</code> element is applicable to
a potential validation subject only if the namespace URI of the
potential validation subject is as specified by the <code>ns</code>
attribute.  Any <code>cover</code> child elements do not affect
this.</p>

<h2>Modes</h2>

<p>The selection of validation subjects and associated schemas may
need to be context dependent.  For example, not all namespace URIs may
be acceptable for the document element, or the document element may
need to be validated against a different schema from that used for
subtrees with the same namespace URI.</p>

<p>Context dependence is specified by means of modes.</p>

<pre>
default namespace = "http://www.thaiopensource.com/ns/mns"

start =
  element rules {
     attribute startMode { mode }?,
     (validate|process)*
  }

validate =
  element validateElement {
    validateModel,
    attribute useMode { mode }?,
    element subsume { nsAtt }*
  }
  | element validateAttributes { validateModel }

process = element lax|strict { modesAtt? }

validateModel = nsAtt, attribute schema { xsd:anyURI }, modesAtt?

modesAtt = attribute modes { list { mode+ } }

nsAtt = attribute ns { xsd:anyURI }

mode = xsd:NCName | "#default"
</pre>

<p>The selection of validation subjects takes place with respect to a
named mode.  A mode is named by an NCName.  In addition, there is a
default mode named <code>#default</code>.  The
<code>validationElement</code> and <code>validateAttributes</code>
elements have an optional <code>modes</code> attribute, which
specifies the modes in which the elements are applicable; it defaults
to the default mode.  It is an error if there is a mode and a
namespace URI for which more than one <code>validationElement</code>
or <code>validateAttributes</code> element is applicable.  Thus, when
an element is selected as a validation subject there is a unique
applicable <code>validateElement</code> element.</p>

<p>The mode used to select whether a particular element or set of
attributes is a validation subject is specified by the
<code>useMode</code> attribute of the <code>validateElement</code>
element applicable to the nearest ancestor validation subject.  The
<code>useMode</code> attribute defaults to the default mode.  If an
element or set of attributes has no ancestor validation subject, then
the mode used is determined by the <code>startMode</code> attribute on
the <code>rules</code> element; this also defaults to the default
mode.  Looking at this more procedurally, processing is top-down; the
starting mode is specified by the <code>startMode</code> attribute.
Within each validation subject element, processing switches to the
mode specified by the <code>useMode</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Whether processing is strict or lax also depends on the mode.  The
<code>strict</code> element has a <code>modes</code> attribute that
specifies the modes in which it applies. As usual, the
<code>modes</code> attribute defaults to the default mode.  There is
also a <code>lax</code> element that allows the processing for a mode
to be explicitly specified as <code>lax</code>.</p>

<p>For every mode named in a <code>useMode</code> attribute other than
the default mode, there must be at least one
<code>validateElement</code>, <code>validateAttribute</code>,
<code>lax</code> or <code>strict</code> element that includes that
mode in its <code>modes</code> attribute.</p>
