<h1>RELAX NG Compact Syntax</h1>

<p>The RELAX NG Compact Syntax is compact, non-XML syntax for <a
href="http://relaxng.org">RELAX NG</a>.  The following are available:</p>

<ul>

<li>a <a href="syntax.html">description</a> of the syntax</li>

<li>an <a href="relaxng.rnc.txt">example</a> showing a schema for
RELAX NG's XML syntax written in the compact syntax (this is optimized
for readability in the compact syntax and is not simply a translation
of <code>relaxng.rng</code>)</li>

</ul>

<p>The following tools provide support for the syntax:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="../jing.html">Jing</a> will validate using
the compact syntax when the <code>-c</code> option is used</li>

<li><a href="../trang.html">Trang</a> can translate schemas written in
the compact syntax; in particular, trang can be used to translate
schemas written in the compact syntax into the standard RELAX NG XML
syntax</li>

</ul>

<p>This syntax is not a part of RELAX NG, and is not a product of the
OASIS RELAX NG TC.  However, the OASIS RELAX NG TC have decided to
produce a compact syntax for RELAX NG, which I expect to be similar to
this syntax.</p>
