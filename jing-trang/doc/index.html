<h1>RELAX NG</h1>

<p>RELAX NG is the name for the unification of two XML schema languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/trex/">TREX</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.xml.gr.jp/relax/">RELAX</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The specification for RELAX NG is being developed by the <a
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/index.shtml">OASIS
RELAX NG TC</a>.</p>

<p>The following are available:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="jing.html">Jing</a>, a validator for RELAX NG implemented
in Java; this is an adaptation of the validator for TREX.  This is
written on top of SAX2.</li>

<li>A RELAX NG <a href="relaxng.rng">schema</a> for RELAX NG (this
matches what is implemented by Jing; the authoritative version is at
<a
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/relaxng.rng"
>OASIS</a>)</li>

<li>A RELAX NG implementation of <a href="xhtml/">XHTML
modularization</a>.</li>

<li>A RELAX NG <a href="xslt.rng">schema</a> for XSLT 1.0 stylesheets.</li>

<li>An XSLT <a href="from-relax.xsl">stylesheet</a> that converts from
RELAX Core into RELAX NG.  This should be able to handle any correct
RELAX Core module, but it does not implement the RELAX Core semantic
of implicitly allowing undeclared attributes. (However, the sample
implementation is capable of recovering from such errors.)  Handling
the RELAX <code>include</code> feature requires an extension over XSLT
1.0; the stylesheet can currently use the extensions implemented in
either MSXML or SAXON; it can be easily adapted to any other
conforming XSLT processor that supports a result tree fragment to node
set conversion function. This stylesheet will not work with XT, since
XT does not implement keys.  There's also an <a
href="simplify.xsl">auxiliary stylesheet</a> that removes some
redundancies generated by the previous stylesheet.</li>

<li>A RELAX NG <a href="relaxCore.rng">schema</a> for RELAX Core,
including the <a href="relaxCoreDatatypes.rng">schema</a> for
datatypes. This was generated using the above stylesheets from the
RELAX module for RELAX core, and then hand-edited a bit.</li>

</ul>
