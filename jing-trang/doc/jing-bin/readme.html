<p>This directory contains version @VERSION@ of Jing, a validator for

<p>Apart from <code>jing.jar</code>, the <code>bin</code> directory
contains some third-party jar files, which are used for XML parsing
(under a pre-1.4 JRE that does not provide the Java XML parsing
extension) and for validating with <a
