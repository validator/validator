Resolve NAME_SPEC, MODEL_GROUP ambiguity using heuristic based on
naming convention or presence of element declarations or whether all
references to the element are via that parameter entity.

Deal with external parameter entities (possibly with TextDecls)
referenced within declarations.

Translation to RELAX NG: undefined elements; namespaces; overridden
attributes; ANY; start based on unreferenced element.

Methods on DTD giving random access to various kinds of declaration.

Check for duplicate ELEMENT declarations.

Overridden general entity declarations.

Overridden external parameter entity declarations.

Try to parse overridden declarations.

Command-line options to expand/not recognize various kinds of ref.

Command-line option to define a parameter entity as INCLUDE.

maybe distinguish char entities in object model

Try to parse ignored marked sections.

Warning for unused parameter entities.

String pasting.

SAXEntityManager (support Norm's entity manager)

Check that no default value for ID.

Check that at most one ID per element type.

Check at most one NOTATION attribute per element.

Check that members of NOTATION enumeration are declared as NOTATION
attributes.

Check that EMPTY elements don't have a NOTATION attribute.

Check that attribute defaults are legal.

Check that notation name of unparsed external entity is declared.

Check no duplicate element names in mixed content model.

Use nameSpec for general entities.

EncodingDetectInputStream should support entities that need an XmlDecl
rather than a TextDecl.

In EncodingDetectInputStream should check that encoding specified in
XML declaration is consistent with auto-detected encoding.

Add a MINIMIZATION_SEMANTIC to deal with TEI RR/RO.
