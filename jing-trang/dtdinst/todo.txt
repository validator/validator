Deal with external parameter entities (possibly with TextDecls)
referenced within declarations.

Translation to RELAX NG: undefined elements; namespaces; overridden

Methods on DTD giving random access to various kinds of declaration.

Check for duplicate ELEMENT declarations.

Try to parse overridden declarations.

Command-line options to expand/not recognize various kinds of ref.

Command-line option to define a parameter entity as INCLUDE.

Maybe distinguish char entities in object model; or perhaps
represent result of parsing entity.

Try to parse ignored marked sections.

Warning for unused parameter entities.

SAXEntityManager (support Norm's entity manager)

Check that no default value for ID.

attributes.

Check that EMPTY elements don't have a NOTATION attribute.

Check that attribute defaults are legal.

Check that notation name of unparsed external entity is declared.

Check no duplicate element names in mixed content model.

Use nameSpec for general entities.

EncodingDetectInputStream should support entities that need an XmlDecl
rather than a TextDecl.

In EncodingDetectInputStream should check that encoding specified in
XML declaration is consistent with auto-detected encoding.

Add a MINIMIZATION_SEMANTIC to deal with TEI RR/RO.

Cleanup handling of newline normalization.

Maybe should disallow colons in names other than element and attribute
