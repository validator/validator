## Want to build, test, and run the code?

Follow the steps below to build, test, and run the checker such that you can open
http://localhost:8888/ in a Web browser to use the checker Web UI.

1. Make sure you have git, python, and JDK 11 or later installed.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

        export JAVA_HOME=@@/PATH/TO/JDK/ON/YOUR/SYSTEM@@

   For example:

   * `export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64` (newer Ubuntu)
   * `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)` (Mac OS X)

3. Create a working directory:

        git clone https://github.com/validator/validator.git

4. Change into your working directory:

        cd validator

5. Start the build script:

        python ./checker.py all

The steps above will build, test, and run the checker such that you can open
http://localhost:8888/ in a Web browser to use the checker Web UI.

Use `python ./checker.py --help` to see command-line options for controlling the
behavior of the script, as well as build-target names you can call separately; e.g.:

* `python ./checker.py build` (to build only)
* `python ./checker.py build test` (to build and test)
* `python ./checker.py run` (to run only)

## Confused about the code? Don’t know where to look?

## Grant of license

Please read the https://github.com/validator/validator/blob/main/DCO file.

By contributing to this project, you agree to license your contributions under
[the MIT license](https://github.com/validator/validator/blob/main/LICENSE)
and to waive any requirement to include an additional copyright notice.

When contributing pull requests, please add a "Signed-off-by" line to your
git commit messages to indicate that you have read all of the content of
https://github.com/validator/validator/blob/main/DCO and that you certify
your code contributions actually conform to the terms of that agreement.

To add a "Signed-off-by" line, invoke `git commit` with the `-s` option:

    git commit -s

To save yourself some time, you probably want to set `user.name` and `user.email`
values in a git config file (e.g., in `~/.gitconfig`), like this:

    [user]
       name = Zaphod Beeblebrox
       email = zaphodb@example.com

Running `git commit -s` will then add a "Signed-off-by" line in this form:

    Signed-off-by: Zaphod Beeblebrox <zaphodb@example.com>

(Of course you need to instead use your own real name and e-mail address.)
