With a few exceptions, this is a record of mainly just user-facing
changes — that is, either changes to the actual behavior of the checker,
or changes to any options/interfaces the checker exposes for developers.

# 17.2.1
06 February 2017
  - Fix bug in language detector that when running the vnu.jar command-line
    checker on a list of documents caused it to sometimes misidentify the
    language of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc., documents. The bug also caused the

# 15.3.28
28 March 2015
  - Renamed from “Nu HTML Checker” to “Nu Html Checker”.
  - Improved error messages for `input[type]` attribute mismatches.
  - Added support for checking `object[typemustmatch]` per-spec.
  - Added error message for `title` element that only has whitespace.
  - Dropped all `meta[name]` checking. Any arbitrary `meta[name]` value
    is now accepted unchecked.
  - Made a couple select/option error messages more precise.
  - Added `useragent` parameter, for allowing you to specify any arbitrary
    user-agent string for the checker to use when fetching remote documents.
  - Added option to limit maximum number of errors shown. Exposed thru
    `nu.validator.messages.limit` Java system prop & `--messages-limit`
    option for the build script. Controls limit on maximum number of
    messages the checker service will report for a single document before
    stopping with a “Too many messages” fatal error.
  - Make the API/CLI (command-line interface) emit source extracts &
    “hilite” info.  When you set the `--format` option to `json`, `xml`,
    `xhtml`, or `html` (but not `gnu` or `text`), the output now includes:
      - an extract from the doc source (`extract` field in JSON output)
      - which extract part to hilight (JSON `hiliteLength` & `hiliteStart`)
      - error range starting line/column (JSON `firstColumn` & `firstLine`)
  - Added full support for checking documents at SNI origins.
  - Fixed regression that caused CLI/API to parse .xhtml docs as text/html
    instead of using the XML parser.
  - Changed backend handling for the case when the “promiscuous-ssl” option
    is on (that is, when you’re requesting the doc-fetching backend ignore
    any SSL/TLS cert errors). This should be a transparent change.
  - Now available from (Maven) Central Repository (nu.validator.validator).
  - Made a number of look&feel refinements to the Web frontend.
  - Replaced all Jena IRI code dependencies with dependency on galimatias.
  - Updated doc-fetching backend to Apache HTTP Components HttpClient 4.4.
  - Upgraded to Jetty 9.2.9 & upgraded many other build/run dependencies to
    latest versions; e.g., log4j 1.2.17, Apache Commons Codec 1.10.
  - Dropped some dependencies that aren’t actually needed.
  - Changed build to cut dependency download size from ~300MB down to ~16MB.
  - Made change to force java to always use Saxon instead of Xalan.
  - Renamed all org.whattf classes to nu.validator.
  - Did large reorganization/consolidation of sources.
  - Added `--javaversion` option, to generate class files targeted for
    particular VM versions (compiles for Java6/1.6 by default).

# 16 February 2015
  - added new "`sizes` attr required when `srcset` specifies width" check
  - added `--skip-non-html` option to CLI; http://goo.gl/sKjRD5
    This change alters the default CLI handling of non-HTML files.
    Before the CLI by default skipped any files without .html, .htm,
    .xhtml, or .xht extensions; instead now by default all files
    found are checked, regardless of extension. The `--skip-non-html`
    option provides the old default behavior: it make the checker skip
    any files without .html, .htm, .xhtml, or .xht extensions.
  - added `--javaversion` option to build script and changed default build
    behavior to now generate vnu.jar/vnu.war builds that can run in Java6
    VMs (as well as in any newer VMs). To generate a vnu.jar/vnu.war build
    with a newer/different VM target, use, e.g., `--javaversion=1.8`.
  - added `--stacksize` option to build script & removed harcoded stack size
  - fixed several bugs in `sizes` checking
  - fixed position reporting of bad character refs in `title` & `textarea`
  - fixed ARIA checking to allow `li[role=separator]` & `time[role=timer]`
  - refined content-type check to treat `.csl` uploads as application/xml
  - refined "unexpected content-type" error msg to include URL of document
  - refined a few things in TestRunner
  - updated Rhino dependency to rhino1_7R5

# 07 February 2015
